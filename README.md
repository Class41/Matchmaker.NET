## Introduction
Matchmaker.NET is a library built in C# and is intended to be used as a compact and basic matchmaking server. Feel free to modify the library as you please, just remember to give credit where credit is due.


## Requirements
Matchmaker.Net will play nice with almost any C# based application. Since sockets are essentially universal, you can use Matchmaker.Net with a client written in almost any language. You will simply
have to write an adapater which is not really that difficult.
