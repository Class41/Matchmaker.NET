!!! WARNING !!!
Since I've been seeing lots of activity on this project, I feel obligated to mention:

I haven't had any time to work on this project as of late. This project is in a incomplete state. Use at your own risk. This should be a good base to start from if you wish to implement something similar in your software. By no means should you expect this to function flawlessly. Also, many features are currently missing. If I have time, I will pick it back up.

## Introduction
Matchmaker.NET is a library built in C# and is intended to be used as a compact and basic matchmaking server. Feel free to modify the library as you please, just remember to give credit where credit is due.


## Requirements
Matchmaker.Net will play nice with almost any C# based application. Since sockets are essentially universal, you can use Matchmaker.Net with a client written in almost any language. You will simply
have to write an adapater which is not really that difficult.
